Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

# Hello

## What I've accomplished

### three hashes

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.

We all have moments when the absurdity of existence seems to abruptly dawn upon us. For those with an absurdist bent of mind, such glimpses can become prolonged reflections - a certain lens through which everyday experiences are filtered and found. I do not claim to understand reality in its totality nor assert these ephemeral, absurd musings as objective truth. They represent but one perspective among many, born in quiet instants of introspection.

One place it often hits me is on the subway. My mind starts wandering as I stare off into space while being jostled in the crowded train car. I begin contemplating the utter strangeness and pointlessness of what we're all doing - cramming ourselves into metal boxes so we can rush somewhere and do some task, only to do it again the next day.
